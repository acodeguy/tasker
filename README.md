# Tasker
### Todo list app built in React using TDD (work-in-progress)
(Current, live version [up on Heroku](https://tasker-react.herokuapp.com/))

## Getting started
Clone the repo to any directory on your hard drive, change into the newly-clone one and run the app:

1. `git clone https://github.com/acodeguy/tasker.git`
2. `cd tasker`
3. `yarn start`

## Tests
This app is being built using a test-first approach with Jest and Enzyme. If that sort of thing interests you, the test suite csan be run from the root directory of the project using:

```yarn test```

## Deployment (CI/CD)

Currently, this app is tested and deployed via Travis CI and Heroku.

## Future Plans

As I'm still learning React as I go, I'm putting most of my energy into that. But I do have plans for the future...

1. Redux
2. Styling w/ Bootstrap
